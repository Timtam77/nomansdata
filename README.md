all the info for no mans sky tables
you will find all of the images for the table here. Lets start with the table, we can work on design as we go.
I will rename all of my files so that they can be easily identified.
I will even have the Unit value in the title so it can be seen in order.
Anyone who wants to contribute can. I'd like this to be a reference for anyone, but mostly those on the newbie front as it will take time for them to get this info.
